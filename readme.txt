SO1H is a small operating system for the 80386+ architecture.
It is written in C using the Smaller C compiler of Alexey Frunze
(http://github.com/alexfru/SmallerC/wiki). Smaller C generates 16 
bits code for NASM that can be assembled and linked to generate
binary executable files of SO1H. The model of programming used 
by those binaries corresponds to the model HUGE proposed by 
Alexei Frunze as part of his Smaller C project.

SO1H arises from the project SO1 (https://github.com/so1h/so1,
https://sourceforge.net/projects/so1) implementation experience. 
SO1 is programmed in C using the Borland C 5.02 binary files 
based on the classic programming model known as SMALL. The SMALL 
model limits the size of the code segment to 64 KBytes. This 
limitation disappears in the HUGE model because the code of each 
function separately can occupy up to 64 KBytes.

Another great advantage of using SmallerC is that pointers take
values corresponding to non-segmented linear directions
in the range 0x00000 to 0xFFFFF, which covers most of the range
of accesible addresses in the pure real mode of the 80386+
(0x000000 to 0x10FFEF).

The SO1H system is mainly aimed at teaching the operating systems 
in a course of initiation in the matter.
